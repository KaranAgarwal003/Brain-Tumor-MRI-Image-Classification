# Brain-Tumor-MRI-Image-Classification
A deep learning project for classifying brain MRI images into four categories: glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, and no tumor. The model uses transfer learning and fine-tuning techniques with data augmentation to improve accuracy and generalization. Designed for medical image analysis and early-stage tumor detection.
